I grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA and am currently pursuing a masters in global affairs on a [Schwarzman Scholarship](https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org) at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. Previously I was a bachelors and masters student in computer science at MIT. I'm interested in developing technology to create fairer, more inclusive and more efficient systems. At MIT I studied machine learning and was a researcher in the [Digital Currency Initiative](https://dci.mit.edu/) where I worked to create protocols to build a more competitive financial system. I'm convinced that technology can solve some of the biggest probelms we face. However the developers of technology are never neutral and I believe that it is our duty to ensure that what we build reflects and advances our values.

Outside of research I am an avid hockey player and traveler. I spent a year studying at Queen's College in Cambridge United Kingdom and have also traveled for research and pleasure in Asia, South America and Africa. On the ice I've played for MIT, won a national championship in the UK (where I always need to add _ice_ to clarify the sport from the much more popular field variety), and intend to extend my history of playing hockey in countries that have never heard of it to include China.
